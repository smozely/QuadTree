# QuadTree

Java Version fo the QuadTree Interview Test. Make sure you read the parent README as well.

## Instructions
Make sure you can get the porject building with the test failing.

`./gradlew build`

Initially you should get some output like

```
quadTree.QuadTreeTest > testIntersect FAILED
    java.io.FileNotFoundException at QuadTreeTest.java:29

1 test completed, 1 failed
:test FAILED

```

The goal of the test is to make that test case pass. Simple :) ... Using a QuadTree

You can change this however you want, as long as the people paired with you understand what you are doing.  

As a starter though you can build from this structure with 3 methods to implement

 - `quadTree.QuadTree.constructFrom` 
 - `quadTree.QuadTree.intersect`
 - `quadTree.QuadTreeTest.getIntersectedSetUsingQuadTree`
